## Overview

Fluent is an ORM framework for Swift. It takes advantage of Swift's strong type system to provide an easy-to-use interface for your database. 
Using Fluent centers around the creation of model types which represent data structures in your database. These models are then used to perform create, read, update, and delete operations instead of writing raw queries.

### Docs & Examples
- [**Vapor's Fluent Documentation**](https://docs.vapor.codes/fluent/overview/)

## Install

Include the following dependency in your Package.swift file
``` swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-libp2p-fluent.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.0.1"))
    ],
        ...
        .target(
            ...
            dependencies: [
                ...
                .product(name: "Fluent", package: "swift-libp2p-fluent"),
            ]),
    ...
)
```

## Usage

### Example 
``` swift
import LibP2P
import Fluent
// import <Your Fluent Driver>

/// Configure your Libp2p networking stack...
let lib = try await Application.make(.detect(), peerID: .ephemeral(.Ed25519))

// To use the database throughout your app
app.databases.use( /*Your database driver*/ )

// To use the configured databse for the peerstore
app.peerstores.use(.fluent)

// To use the configured database for cache 
app.caches.use(.fluent)

```
